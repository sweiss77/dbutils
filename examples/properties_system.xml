  This is a sample properties file, you can copy this file to a new name
  and customize it according to your application's requirements. You must
  name your new file according to the following convention:
  
  properties_[property-set-name].xml
  
  where "property-set-name" is the name you want to give to the set of
  properties contained in the file, and is the same as the "name" attribute
  of the propertySet element (which is the root element in this file). So
  for example, if you have a set of properties that you want to call "foo",
  the file would be called "properties_foo.xml". And the root element would
  be:
  
  <propertySet name="foo" ... />
  
  The label and description attributes are for display purposes only and can
  be whatever you want them to be.
  
  Your properties files should be located in a directory called "properties"
  directly under the WEB-INF directory. So the full path to a properties file
  might be something like:
  
  /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/myapp/WEB-INF/properties/properties_system.xml
  
  You can add as many "propertyGroup" elements as desired inside the "propertySet"
  element. You can also add as many "property" elements as desired inside each
  "propertyGroup" element.
